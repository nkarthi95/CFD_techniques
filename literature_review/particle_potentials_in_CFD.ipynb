    "Assumptions made during the development of the Hertzian contact force are that the strains are small and within the elastic limit of the materials in contact, the surface area in contact is much smaller than the size of the contacting bodies, the surfaces are perfectly smooth and therefore frictionless and the applied forces are all orthogonal to any surface. With these assumptions, the core equation of the Hertzian contact force revolves around solving the elastic deflection $u_z \\equiv [m]$ of a surface as another surface(denoted with ' in this notation) is contacting it under an applied pressure $p(x', y')$. The elastic deformation is expressed as a ratio of the reduced elastic modulus $\\bar{E} \\equiv [Pa]$ to the surface energy, expressed as an integral of the applied pressure over the area of application in the equation below.\n",

Due to the assumptions made, p_0 can be simplified to the elastic modulus of the material making up the sphere, defined as $K$. If the material is not known or is arbitrarily specifies as is usually the case in LB simulations, the strength of this potential, modulated with $K$ must be chosen carefully. Too high and numerical instability will occue due to large changes in pressure upon contact. Too low and the particles will overlap by more than 10% of their total volume.\n",

    "Lubrication forces arise when an incompressible fluid is squeezed between two incompressible solids, resulting in a strongly repulsive force created as the fluid is squeezed out of the gap. Characterizing this force is known as lubrication theory. Durlosky, Brady and Bossis developed a theory which explicitly calculated the forces created from this near contact, where previously meshes of the particle were required to construct an accurate model of the interparticle lubrication forces.\n",

    "The first type of lubrication force calculation is applicable to situations where forces and torques are prescribed with no shear flow imposed. The second version does not make any assumptions, and can be used under shear flow. However it requires more computation time.
